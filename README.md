# Learning Web GL

I want to learn WebGL to render some 3d scenes.

I want to render 3d scenes and capture then into a 2d image and feedback these into a object detection network in order to get a feel for the accuracy of the network.  Basically I want to use webgl to generated large number of data sets.


## What do I want to do

I want to render a scene with a moving ball on a playing field.
Below is the initial scene.

There is a tennis ball at the center of the image and the tennis court revolves around the tennis ball.
